You are not designing a new layout.
You are replicating an existing system.

Reference file:
FreshOutPage.tsx

All new case study pages must match it structurally.

🔒 STRICT RULES

Do NOT create new layout structures.

Do NOT invent spacing.

Do NOT modify typography scale.

Do NOT use inline styles.

Do NOT add mx-5 or custom padding overrides.

Do NOT manually recreate shared sections.

Only use existing shared components.

🧱 STRUCTURE REQUIREMENT

Every new case study page must follow EXACT order:

Hero Section (same layout as FreshOut)

Project Metadata Section (Role, Duration, etc.)

Problem Statement

Research Overview (shared component)

Discovery

Persona

Competitive Audit

Key Insights (shared component)

How Might We

Solution Overview

Information Architecture

User Flow

Wireframes (Lo-Fi + Hi-Fi)

Next Steps

Contact Section

Order must match exactly.

📐 SPACING STANDARD

If section uses TwoColumnSection:
Right column MUST have:

md:pt-16


Section wrapper spacing must match FreshOut.

No custom spacing allowed.

🎯 TYPOGRAPHY STANDARD

Use EXACT same classes as FreshOut:

Headings:

text-4xl md:text-5xl font-medium


Body:

text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed


Lists:
Use flex bullet system
NOT <ul> list-disc

🧩 COMPONENT RULE

If FreshOut uses:

<ResearchOverview />
<KeyInsights />
<TwoColumnSection />
<ContentSection />

You MUST use same component.

Do NOT rewrite section manually.

📸 ASSET RULE

When I provide:

• Screenshot of section
• Asset images

You must:

Extract text exactly

Place it inside correct component

Preserve layout system

Match spacing from FreshOut

Do NOT guess missing content.
If content is missing → ask.

🧠 VALIDATION STEP (MANDATORY)

Before finishing page, verify:

Does structure match FreshOut?

Are shared components used?

Is md:pt-16 applied?

Is typography identical?

Are lists using flex bullets?

Are section paddings consistent?

If not identical → fix.
