Skill name: CaseStudyNormalizer
Purpose: Normalize, fix, or build case-study sections so all case-study pages visually match the FreshOut reference without introducing cascading layout changes.

Context:

Reference / canonical page: FreshOutPage.tsx (use its classes, wrapper, spacing, and typography as the single source of truth).

Pages to normalize: BonderCaseStudy.tsx, RecordzPage.tsx, BabyThriftPage.tsx (and any additional case study pages supplied).

Theme folder remains authoritative for shared components — do NOT change theme files.

Hard global rules (MUST obey)

Audit first. Produce a structured audit report (see Output format) before making any edits.

Do NOT modify: theme/ folder, navbar, footer, global design tokens.

Do NOT refactor component structure; only apply targeted normalization unless audit shows structural mismatch that prevents parity (then propose, don't apply).

Make changes only to the listed case study pages and only where they deviate from FreshOut.

Use Tailwind utilities only for typography/spacing adjustments (use bracket utilities if exact px required). Remove inline styles where possible.

Preserve functionality (links, buttons, responsiveness). Run smoke tests (no console errors).

Step A — Audit (mandatory, no edits):
For each target page, compare the following against FreshOutPage.tsx and report exact differences (classes and px where relevant):

Container wrapper (max-w, px, mx-auto)

Section wrapper spacing (py / mt classes)

Heading class sets (text size, weight, line-height classes)

Paragraph class sets (text size, leading)

List classes (space-y, pl vs list-inside, text color)

Grid definitions (e.g., md:grid-cols-2, gaps) and any custom column fractions

Any inline styles or absolute-positioned blocks in the page code

Image container rules used in page (height, object-fit, alignment)
Produce the audit as a table: Page | Element | FreshOut class | Page class | Difference | Severity (low/medium/high)

Step B — Propose normalization plan:
Using the audit output, generate a minimal plan for each page that lists concrete replacements (exact Tailwind classes to copy from FreshOut). Example line:
BonderCaseStudy.tsx — SolutionOverview list: replace class "space-y-2 list-inside" → "space-y-6 md:space-y-8 pl-5 text-[#6e6764] text-lg md:text-xl"
Ask for confirmation only if any proposed change would affect layout beyond that page (e.g., changing grid column fractions like md:grid-cols-[1.2fr_1fr]).

Step C — Apply normalization (only after audit/proposal):
For each approved item:

Replace classes exactly as in FreshOut (or use the proposed exact class replacement).

Remove inline styles that conflict with tailwind classes. If removal creates regression, revert and flag for manual review.

Ensure images use style={{ height: '100%', objectFit: 'cover' }} inside the fixed-height preview container; top-align containers when FreshOut shows anchored visuals.

Ensure description paragraphs use 2-line clamp where FreshOut uses truncation: display:-webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp:2; -webkit-box-orient:vertical; overflow:hidden; line-height:1.5 (apply only on project grid cards, not on case study copy).

For headings that break: run grid-aware diagnostic (see Step D) before applying md:whitespace-nowrap.

Step D — Grid-aware heading fix (prevent overflow):
For any major heading that wraps undesirably:

Check whether heading sits inside md:grid-cols-2. If yes, measure the heading column width (desktop).

If width >= required width for a single line at current font size, apply md:whitespace-nowrap.

If width is too small, propose adjusting column ratio (e.g., md:grid-cols-[1.2fr_1fr] or md:grid-cols-[1.3fr_1fr]) — do not apply without confirmation.

Step E — Typographic & alignment lock:
Enforce these standard classes (copy exactly from FreshOut):

Problem statement / big headings: text-4xl md:text-5xl font-semibold leading-tight (replace with FreshOut exact if different)

Subheaders: font-medium text-xl md:text-2xl mb-6

Body: text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed

Lists: space-y-6 md:space-y-8 text-[#6e6764] text-lg md:text-xl pl-5

Global alignment inside the case-study wrapper: text-left (overwrite any text-center in these pages)

Step F — Visual parity checks:
After modifications:

Render page in desktop (1440px) and mobile breakpoints.

Take before/after screenshots for the modified sections.

Run visual checklist: container width same, section spacing same (± 2px), heading line breaks match FreshOut, no overflow/scrollbars.

Step G — Outputs (deliver exactly):
For every run, return:

Audit table (as described)

Proposed changes (diff-like list)

Files modified (paths) + small code diffs (before → after snippets)

Verification screenshots or DOM confirmations (if possible)

Final confirmation: All pages normalized to FreshOut reference OR list of remaining blockers that need human approval

Safety & rollback:

If any change causes layout regression outside target page, automatically revert that change and log it as reverted — needs manual review.

Begin by running Step A (audit) and return the report.
